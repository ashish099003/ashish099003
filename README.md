## Hi, I’m Ashish Sinha

AI / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in building **production-grade ML systems**, **agentic AI workflows**, and **data-intensive platforms**.  
My work focuses on taking AI from **experimentation to reliable, scalable systems**.

I have hands-on experience across **ML modeling, LLM systems, RAG pipelines, multi-agent architectures**, and **engineering-heavy AI workflows** used in real-world environments.

### What I Work On

**Machine Learning & AI Systems**
- Supervised & unsupervised learning: classification, regression, anomaly detection
- Deep learning fundamentals: neural networks, autoencoders, representation learning
- Model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance trade-offs

**LLMs, Agents & Applied GenAI**
- Agent-based systems: single-agent, multi-agent orchestration, tool-calling
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): vector search, hybrid retrieval, evaluation
- Prompt design for structured outputs, intent generation, and reasoning workflows
- MCP-based tool integration and agent frameworks (CrewAI / AutoGen patterns)

**ML Engineering & Data Systems**
- End-to-end ML pipelines: data ingestion → feature processing → inference
- Model validation, monitoring, and explainability considerations
- Working with large-scale datasets and performance-sensitive systems
- Strong emphasis on correctness, reproducibility, and maintainability

**Software & Platform Engineering**
- Python-first development with production-quality code
- Designing APIs, services, and internal tools for ML workflows
- Experience with cloud-native systems and distributed processing concepts
- CI/CD, testing strategies, and operational reliability

---

### Selected Work & Repositories

- **AI / ML Experiments & Prototypes**  
  Practical implementations covering ML algorithms, neural networks, and evaluation techniques.

- **LLM & Agent Systems**  
  Repositories showcasing RAG pipelines, multi-agent coordination, prompt-driven systems, and MCP-based tools.

- **Engineering-Focused Utilities**  
  Supporting tools for data validation, automation, and ML experimentation.

> I prioritize **clear problem framing**, **clean abstractions**, and **working code** over toy examples.

### Technical Stack

**Languages**  
`Python`, `SQL`, `Bash`

**ML / AI**  
`scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`  
LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, prompt engineering

**Systems & Tooling**  
APIs, async workflows, CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms  
Git, testing frameworks, logging & observability

### How I Think About AI

I approach AI systems as **engineering products**, not demos:
- Models must be **interpretable, testable, and observable**
- Performance improvements should be **measurable and explainable**
- LLMs are tools—valuable when integrated thoughtfully into systems

---

### Currently Exploring

- Advanced agent architectures and coordination strategies  
- Evaluation frameworks for LLM and RAG systems  
- Scalable ML system design for real-time and batch workloads
